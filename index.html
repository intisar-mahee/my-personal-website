        <h3>My Background Story</h3>
        <p>I admitted into an Engineering University from the interest of Robotics, Automation & Control engineering. Then I felt interested about start-ups & started a new online based venture in a local area. It drove me to many learning and I realized how wrong I was about entrepreneurship. I ended up selling my small venture & move forward with something else. By this time I realized, how much digital marketing can effect the online business. Besides I did an introductory course of Digital Marketing which showed me the opportunities of Digital Marketing in online & offline businesses & I realized how far this can go on.</p>
