        <h3>My Background Story</h3>
        <p>I admitted into an Engineering University from the interest of Robotics, Automation & Control engineering. Then I felt interested about start-ups & started a new online based venture in a local area. It drove me to many learning and I realized how wrong I was about entrepreneurship. I ended up selling my small venture & move forward with something else. By this time I realized, how much digital marketing can effect the online business. Besides I did an introductory course of Digital Marketing which showed me the opportunities of Digital Marketing in online & offline businesses & I realized how far this can go on.</p>

        <h2>Dream Big</h2>
        <h3>Become a Web Developer</h3>
        <p>From then I devoted myself to the courses & contents of Digital Marketing and trying to learn new things on daily basis. I’m an expert on Google Analytics & moving forward to be an expert on Social Media Marketing, Brand Management, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) & Search Engine Management (SEM).
            Besides I also do content writing as my hobby & do professional photography from my self-interest. (Working as a Freelance Photographer for six years)
            I believe that photography and content writing are the major parts of Digital Marketing. Someone who has both skills can be a real game changer.</p>

            <p>A wise man once said, "It’s more important to know what you don’t know." I believe, I’m the person who always wants to learn new things & never afraid of doing mistakes rather learning to do things properly.</p>
